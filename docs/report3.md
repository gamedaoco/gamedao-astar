# GameDAO UCG Update 03

Thank you to all contributors supporting GameDAO via Astar DappStaking. This gives us as a small team more confidence (and capacity) to build and invest in this eco.

## ⚙️ Technical developments and updates

Over the last weeks we have completed our Astar testnet setup, the ongoing developments will become visible on both gamedao.app and astar.gamedao.app, where the latter will feature an interactive staking dashboard to show contributors and stakers ongoing reward programs and achievements.

Furthermore, the mentioned issues with the graph have been resolved, we are running now a multichain graph with indexed data from various networks including Astar.

On the frontend side we have to continue our refactoring, as we are buiding various sites and apps from our haiku codebase. This means various core bits from the individual apps migrate to global packages in the repo to reduce development debt.

## 📣 Marketing and communication updates

There are no updates on the marketing side as we are focused on releasing version one of the contracts and Astar specific dashboard.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Updates on community, partnerships and collaborations

- We have created a proposal to list $GAME token on Astar L1. This proposal passed and we will be able to move $GAME between Asset Hub, Astar L1 and Hydration.net, where we set up a small pool.

- We keep on working with existing and new partners and game studios to motivate new builds on Astar L1 and Soneium.

## 💸 dApp Staking rewards spent and reason for spending and uses

We have spent all received rewards for operational expenses of the company.

## 📅 Status of UCG milestones

Draft for porting the protocols was published in update 01.

✅ August “setup”: driving the roadmap for the complete protocol and sales funnel

✅ September “blueprints”

✅ October focus on infrastructure, listing on Astar L1

- xcm <> ink <> evm interaction → This needs more info from e.g. Astar dev team
- proxy / upgradability → Prototype exists

→ November "validation”

## 🦾 Roadmap for next month

Keep going as suggested in our roadmap, initiate discussion with technical people on Astar.

- due to infrastructure and frontend work we had to slow down on the protocol developments. Next stop is the deployment of an initial ink version potentially by end of November

- Transfer AssetHub <> Astar L1 <> Hydration
- Integrate into dapp:
  - show GAME balance(s)
  - show staking information and accumulated GAME rewards
  - start a collective with GAME

## 🥷 Current blockers or problems that the team is facing

At the current point, there are no blockers. We are fixing the frontend stack to be ready for the next steps, testing out interaction between native pallets, ink contracts communicating with native pallets and EVM contracts communicating with both, pallets and ink contracts.
